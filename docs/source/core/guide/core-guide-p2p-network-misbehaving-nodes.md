Take note that for both types of broadcasting, mechanisms are in place to punish misbehaving <<glossary:peers>> who take up bandwidth and computing resources by sending false information. If a peer gets a banscore above the `-banscore=<n>` threshold (100 by default), they will be banned for the number of seconds defined by `-bantime=<n>`, which is 86,400 by default (24 hours).
