Dash's <<glossary:masternode>> quorums are used to facilitate the operation of masternode provided features in a decentralized, deterministic way. The original quorums (used largely for <<glossary:InstantSend>> and masternode payments) were ephemeral and used for a single purpose (e.g. voting on one specific InstantSend transaction).

Dash Core 0.14 (protocol version 70214) introduced the <<glossary:Long-Living Masternode Quorum>>  (LLMQ) system described in detail by [DIP6](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md). These LLMQs are deterministic subsets of the global deterministic masternode list that are formed via a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol and remain active for a long periods of time (e.g. hours to days).

The main task of LLMQs is to perform threshold signing of consensus-related messages (e.g. <<glossary:ChainLocks>>).

# LLMQ Signing Session

The following table details the data flow of P2P messages exchanged during an LLMQ signing session. These sessions take advantage of BLS threshold signatures to enable quorums to sign arbitrary messages. For example, Dash Core 0.14 uses this capability to create the quorum signature found in the [`clsig` message](core-ref-p2p-network-instantsend-messages#clsig) that enables <<glossary:ChainLocks>>.

Please read [DIP7 LLMQ Signing Requests / Sessions](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0007.md) for additional details.

*LLMQ Signing Session Data Flow*

| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| **[Siging Request Phase](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0007.md#signing-request)** | | | Request quorum signing of a message (e.g. InstantSend transaction input) (intra-quorum communication) |

| **[Share Propagation Phase](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0007.md#propagating-signature-shares)** | | | Members exchange signature shares within the quorum (intra-quorum communication) |
| [`qsigsinv` message](core-ref-p2p-network-quorum-messages#qsigsinv)                             | → |                              | Masternode sends one or more quorum signature share inventories _to other masternodes in the quorum_<br>_May occur multiple times in this phase_

| **[Threshold Signature Recovery Phase](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0007.md#recovered-threshold-signatures)** | | | A recovered signature is created by a quorum member once valid signature shares from at least the threshold number of members have been received |
| [`qsigrec` message](core-ref-p2p-network-quorum-messages#qsigrec)                             | → |                              | Masternode sends the quorum recovered signature **to all peers** (except those that have asked to be excluded via a [`qsendrecsigs` message](core-ref-p2p-network-quorum-messages#qsendrecsigs))

Note the following timeouts defined by Dash Core related to signing sessions:

| Parameter | Timeout, sec | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SESSION_NEW_SHARES_TIMEOUT` | 60 | Time to wait for new shares |
| `SIG_SHARE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | 5 | Time to wait for a requested share before requesting from a different node |
| `SESSION_TOTAL_TIMEOUT` | 300 | Time to wait for session to complete |

# Quorum Configuration

Mainnet and Testnet only use quorums of pre-defined sizes that are hard coded into Dash Core. RegTest and Devnet environments each have a quorum that supports custom size and threshold parameters that are controlled via command line or configuration file parameters (`llmqtestparams`/`llmqdevnetparams`).

A list of all the quorums and their default sizes can be found in the [Current LLMQ Types table](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0006.md#current-llmq-types) found in DIP-6.
