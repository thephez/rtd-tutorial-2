  Blockchain
    A `blockchain <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)>`_ is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of data records hardened against tampering and revision. It consists of data structure blocks — which exclusively hold data in initial blockchain implementations, and both data and programs in some of the more recent implementations — with each block holding batches of individual transactions and the results of any blockchain executables. Each block contains a timestamp and information linking it to a previous block.

  51% Attack
      A condition in which more than half the computing power on a cryptocurrency network is controlled by a single miner or group of miners. That amount of power theoretically makes them the authority on the network. This means that every client on the network believes the attacker’s hashed transaction block.

  Address
    A Dash address is used to :ref:`Send/Receive a Payment <dashcore-send-receive>` on the Dash network. It contains a string of alphanumeric characters, but can also be represented as a scannable QR code. A Dash address is also the public key in the pair of keys used by Dash holders to digitally sign transactions (see Public key).

  API
    In computer programming, an `application programming interface (API) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface>`_ is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and applications.
